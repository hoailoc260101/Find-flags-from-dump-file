Find flags from dump file
With a memory dump file. We are supposed to get all the flags using memory forensics tools (mainly volatility).

Challenge DescriptionPermalink
My sisterâ€™s computer crashed. We were very fortunate to recover this memory dump. Your job is get all her important files from the system. From what we remember, we suddenly saw a black window pop up with some thing being executed. When the crash happened, she was trying to draw something. Thats all we remember from the time of crash.
Note: This challenge is composed of 3 flags.
